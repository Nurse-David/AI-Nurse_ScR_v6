# AI Nurse Systematic Review

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks for conducting an AI-assisted nursing systematic review.

## Setup

It is recommended to use a Python virtual environment. The following steps use `venv`, which is included with Python 3.10+.

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This installs all required packages found in `requirements.txt`.

## Notebooks

- `Nurse-AI_ScR_v6.2.ipynb`
- `Nurse_AI_ScR_v6_3.ipynb`

Run the notebooks in your preferred environment (e.g., VS Code, Jupyter Lab, or Google Colab) after activating the virtual environment.
